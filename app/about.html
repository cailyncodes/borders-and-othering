                <h2>History and Description</h2>
                <p>This project is primarily produced by Cailyn Hansen in 2019 as her Brown University Senior Capstone in Ethnic Studies.</p>
                <p>Cailyn’s interest in digital humanities and mapping as a medium has its roots in her involvement with the Mapping Violence Project led by Professor Monica Martinez of Brown University. Cailyn served as a software engineer with the team from February 2016 to June 2018, and again as digital project consultant from May 2019 to the present.</p>
                <p>A central goal of this project is to combat a public amnesia about the role of maps and the history of the U.S.-Mexico border. Maps are often upheld as objective representations of space. This project explores how we can complicate this idea and highlight the subjectivity inherent in any mapping project.</p>
                <p>Suggested citation style for this project is: Hansen, Cailyn. Borders and Othering: (De)Constructing Maps of North America. Version 1 published May 8, 2019. http://bordersandothering.org, accessed [DATE].</p>
                <h2>Additional Work</h2>
                <p>This is still much work left to be done with this project. The geographic data can be made more precise and comprehensive. The boundaries of land and water, for example, don’t entirely match satellite data. Short-lived independent republics, such as the Republic of Central America, are absent from the data and map.</p>
                <p>While many hidden dimensions of maps are considered here, there are still more that can be explored. These include projection, orientation, and naming of geographic features, to list a few.</p>
                <p>Additional conversations about indigeneity and epistemology of land ownership and geographic representations of data are necessary.</p>
                <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
                <p>I am extremely thankful for the feedback and suggestions from the Brown Undergraduate Ethnic Studies Cohort of 2019, which pushed this project to be more cognizant of indigenous lands and the impact of Euro-centric ideas of mapping. The inclusion of an overlay of indigenous territory can be traced to their comments.</p>
                <p>Daniel Kim, my capstone advisor, provided invaluable assistance in shaping the scope of this project. I must also thank Professor Kim for his flexibility in allowing me to create a digital capstone and reinterpret our requirements.</p>
                <p>A huge thank you and shout out to Monica Martinez who assisted in the distribution and publication of this project. She also provided numerous suggestions and ideas for developing related material for this digital project. This project would not have been possible without her advice.</p>
