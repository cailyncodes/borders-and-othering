                    <p>We acknowledge that mapping is largely a colonial project that centers nation states while ignoring indigenous people and their voices. This project closely examines the relationship of nation states, territorial control, and the contestation of space. In doing so, indigenous nations are potentially made invisible. In recognizing this, many mapping displays throughout this project leave a semi-opaque but noticeable overlay of indigenous land claims to remind viewers of the expropriation of space. The boundaries presented are those from <a href="http://native-land.ca" target="_blank">Native Land Digital</a> – an indigenous-peoples-run non-profit using primarily indigenous ontologies to create these boundaries. Requiring that borders use certain evidence systems is damaging and continues the colonizing work of mapping. As such, the boundaries may not line up neatly, but that does not mean the data is any less valid.</p>
                    <br />
                    <p>We also acknowledge that North America was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples. If you are in North America (or many parts of other continents), you are most likely on indigenous land that was stolen by oppressors who committed acts of violence. You should take a moment to check out Native Land Digital, identify what indigenous lands you are occupying, and reflect on what it means to be on seized indigenous land. Don’t worry, we will wait for you.</p>
