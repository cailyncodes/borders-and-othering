            As you go through this tour, we will be leading up to the question,
            "What is a map?" We first ask, however, "What is on a map?" To help
            answer this, we look to a commonly seen and used map: Google Maps.
            Take a moment to jot down what you see and notice on this map. Feel
            free to zoom in and drag the map around as well if you want.

            It seems that maps are describing the space and things around us.
            They serve to document, name, and label. We can also think of maps
            as useful tools for navigating this space – how to get from place to
            place. They also tell us what exists in the places we cannot see.

            Now that we’ve discussed what is on a map, we need to ask what is
            missing. This might be harder to answer but take a moment to think
            about what information could be included on a map that this map does
            not include.

          <p>
            So far, we have only looked at one map. Use the drop down below to
            explore different versions of this map. Pay attention to how the
            information displayed changes with each of these versions. What is
            included on one version that is missing from another?
          </p>

          <p>
            If you were only to see one of these maps, what would be difficult
            to identify?
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We suggest that on the maps that do not include borders it would be
            difficult to determine the border between countries and states.
            Consider how that affects understandings of nationhood and
            immigration policies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            On the maps without data about the terrain, information about the
            three-dimensionality of space is lost. Instead, it appears that all
            the land has no elevation change. Also, these maps hide details
            about forest coverage and many other geographic features that
            provide useful context to the space in question.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There are many other features you may have noticed that are
            difficult or easy to identify depending on the different maps. Our
            selections above are not meant to be exhaustive. Your alternatives
            are valid and contribute to the wide array of uses of maps.

          <h1 class="center">What maps are not</h1>
          <p>
            We began by saying we were building up to question of “What is a
            map?” Before answering that, we think it is important to consider
            what maps are not. Despite what may be our initial intuition, maps
            are not objective. As we have seen, there are several ways to
            represent the same space. These different versions are the results
            of many decisions and often reflect the opinions (and biases) of the
            people making the map. What happens when the people making maps try
            to tell a specific story that leaves out important details?

            For the rest of this tour, we will be switching to a different
            digital map that will allow us to piece together various mapping
            components and see what happens when we mix them together in
            different ways.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Here is a map in one of its simplest forms. We will be using this to
            build up to more detailed maps. Notice that the only features it
            includes are land/water boundaries and two different colors denoting
            land and water, respectively.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            A central theme we will explore is what we call "hidden dimensions
            of maps." This refers to the context of a map – such as the
            geography, date, and labeling authority (the people who assign names
            to places), for example – that changes the way a map appears but
            often is not explicitly mentioned. How would maps look if we changed
            these hidden dimensions?

          <h1 class="center">Deconstructing Borders</h1>
          <p>
            First, we are going to add the borders of political entities and
            indigenous groups. We are going to focus on the impact of declaring
            borders and how they function to control space.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The purple overlay corresponds to the territory of indigenous
            communities as defined by
            <a href="http://native-land.ca" target="_blank"
              >Native Land Digital</a
            >. You will also see the political borders of countries, states, and
            counties in a grey outline. These correspond to the present-day
            borders. Notice how they all fit together with no overlap. This is
            largely premised on the Euro-centric idea that only one person can
            own a plot of land.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Notice also, however, that there is much overlap of the
            indigenous-land data. Native Land Digital says, "Overlapping [data]
            allows people to get a sense of the depth and complexity of
            Indigenous history where they live." This challenges Euro-centric
            models of mapping and territory control. The origin of mapping was
            in part for the need to identify the extent of territory and to
            support war and violence to enforce these borders. It is innately
            difficult for maps as a form to display overlapping data.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The maps that most people use only have the borders of countries,
            states, and possibly cities or counties. Think about what message
            this sends to indigenous peoples and how their histories are erased
            and forgotten.
          </p>

          <p>
            There is an entire field of study dedicated to borders: Border
            Studies. With this field, we can see that there are different types
            of borders, different ways of describing borders, and different ways
            of understanding the impact of borders. We won’t delve into all of
            this, but you can check out the reading list for a selection of
            articles.

          <p>
            So far, we have looked at modern maps with the current political
            boundaries and borders. It is important to remember that borders,
            both political and geographic, change over time. Time is one of the
            strongest hidden dimensions on maps. This is not to say that maps
            omit labeling time. Rather, it is the absence of borders and
            geographic features from earlier times that presents a version of
            history that ignores or forgets the past, which includes land theft,
            war, and violence.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            We currently only look at the changes of the borders of countries
            over time. However, if you want to learn more about indigenous land
            over time and see maps of the seizure of such lands by the United
            States, check out

            In order to better represent how land loss occurred, we will overlay
            shaded regions corresponding to the present-day borders of Mexico
            and the United States. The data on country borders used here is
            original data modified from several data sets. You can read more
            about this on the <a href="./data.html">Data tab</a>.

            the year of Mexico’s independence – to 1859, the last year of
            substantial change in this border and effectively the present-day
            border.

            Notice how much the border has changed. With the original border,
            Mexico included the entirety of California, Nevada, Arizona, New
            Mexico, Texas, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. In 1845,
            Then-General Zachary Taylor, without provocation, led the U.S.
            invasion into Mexico. This act of aggression, fueled in part by U.S.
            westward expansion launched the start of the three-year long
            Mexican-American War. Its end was marked by Treaty of
            Guadalupe-Hidalgo, which outlined the theft of over 55% of Mexico’s
            pre-war territory claim.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Families, friends, businesses, and towns were newly divided,
            separated from each other by an imposed political border and
            constructed sense of national belonging. While Americans of Mexican
            descent are often cast as foreign, activists and scholars often
            repeat the quip, "We didn’t cross the border; the border crossed
            us." For decades following the ratification of the treaty, people
            continued to freely move as they had between the new U.S.-Mexico
            boundary. Their reality was not yet defined by the artificial
            division of land. Even the Rio Grande, which appears to create a
            physical border, was crossed liberally.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The movement of the border over time and the movement of people
            across the border has been largely lost in the public’s memory.
            Media and politicians describe the current border with language that
            suggests a permanent past unchanged from the present. This idea is
            one of the many ways support is garnered for various xenophobic
            projects, such as a border wall.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Consider the role that maps have in hiding this history. When we
            look at most modern maps, they show no indication of this
            contentious past. They also support political rhetoric that treats
            migrants as "illegal" by deeming the border as a fixed political
            necessity.

            None of these languages are indigenous languages nor for places of
            indigenous land. We have added the ability that if you click on the
            map, a list of indigenous communities that contain that point will
            be shown below (again, this data is from Native Land Digital). It
            most cases, the name will be the indigenous-language name.

            It is also important to remember that many indigenous groups have
            names for space that are ignored by most mapping authorities or
            dominant groups. An example of this is Bdé Makhá Ská, a lake in
            Očeti Šakówiŋ/Minnesota. You can read more about this with

            A great book to read is Keith Basso’s
            <em>Wisdom Sits in Places</em>. He describes how the Apache peoples
            understand space and place and how their naming conventions provide
            unique insights to promote culture and memory.

          <p>
            Now that we have taken some time to interactively explore maps, let
            us look back on some historical maps and see if we can identify how
            they were functioning. As you look at the next series of maps, think
            about specifically what they leave out and how that influences the
            viewer’s understanding of space.

            There was this idea in the United States during the 19th and 20th
            century called "manifest destiny." It suggested that the white
            citizens in the United States had a God-given right to expand
            westward, including stealing the land and killing those who got in
            their way. It was partly because of manifest destiny that the United
            States invaded Mexico and started the Mexican-America War. Manifest
            destiny also played a role in the displacement and murder of
            indigenous peoples.

            In this section, we ask you to construct your own map. Using what we
            have covered so far and the examples you have seen, take some time
            to play around with the different features we currently support to
            build your own map!

            In reflecting on all that we have covered, we want to end by asking
            you again what you see or notice on maps and what you do not? There
            is no right or wrong answer, as we hope to have demonstrated
            throughout this website.

            In answering the question we started with ("What is a map?"), we
            tried to show that there is not simple answer. Maps are the
            aggregate of complex decision making, worrying history of
            colonialism, and misrepresentation. This is not to say that maps
            cannot be useful. However, we all must acknowledge the ways maps
            have been and continue to be used. Further, we need to reimagine
            what is possible with maps and consider alternative ways to
            represent spatial information. For more ideas, check out Shelley
            Fishkin’s idea of a

            We hope that you were able to take something of meaning from this
            experience. In particular, we hope you were able to see maps in a
            new light that you had not previously considered. We also want to
            note that there are many more types of maps and data features that
            we did not cover here. We encourage you to discuss with others who
            have completed this tour to see what their thoughts are and if they
            have ideas for what other things map can encode.
